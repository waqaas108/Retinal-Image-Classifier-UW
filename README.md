# Retinal-Image-Classifier-UW
This project implements a CNN-based visual classifier for retinal images, focusing on identifying various conditions like Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), and Glaucoma. The model has been optimized through hyperparameter tuning and enhanced with attention mechanisms like CBAM and Transformer.
